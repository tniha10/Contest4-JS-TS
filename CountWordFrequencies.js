{/**Given a sentence, return an object containing the frequency count of each word. Ignore case differences (e.g., treat "The" and "the" as the same word).

Examples
countWordFrequencies("Hello world, hello!");
// Expected output:
// {"hello": 2, "world": 1}

countWordFrequencies("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.");
// Expected output:
// {"the": 2, "quick": 1, "brown": 1, "fox": 1, "jumps": 1, "over": 1, "lazy": 1, "dog": 1}

Example 1
Input: sentence = "Hello world, hello!"
Output: {"hello":2,"world":1}

Example 2
Input: sentence = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."
Output: {"brown":1,"dog":1,"fox":1,"jumps":1,"lazy":1,"over":1,"quick":1,"the":2}

Constraints
The input `sentence` will be a string.
Words consist of alphanumeric characters. Punctuation and spaces should be ignored when determining words. */}

    let words = sentence.toLowerCase().split(/[^a-z0-9]+/);
